<h3> Final blog </h3>
<br>

<li> Initially, since Jack and I made the game ourselves, we had thought about expanding the game ourselves. However, for the final project, we decided to invite Mona to join us because our idea was to expand on the art details such as characters and backgrounds and this would probably take a longer time. After having work added for the final draft, we realized that our game has had much more success than we thought. Players responded very well to the story based game. I think that what makes our game interesting is the voice embedded to the characters and smooth storyline. In my opinion, I think players should be interested in talking about our game because The Smoking Gun is very interactive and allows the player to choose their own path. Unlike most games from other classmates, we choose to make a story based game which to some might be perhaps an easy route, actually takes a lot of work in perfecting the story. My partner Jack has done a great job in adding major details in the story and I have taken plenty of time on adding great detail in the poses/emotions of the characters and backgrounds. Because our game did expand after the prototype, Mona has helped in creating more emotions/poses  for the characters as well. Working in this group project has allowed me to learn about teamwork in the gaming world. For instance, how crucial communication needs to be. Also, the process since the start and to where it is right now, is interesting and gratifying to witness.</li>
