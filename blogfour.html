<h3>Three games played</h3>
<br>
*Interview a cat<br>
*Coffin counseling<br>
*Jurassic heart<br>
<br>
<h4>Jurassic Heart and Interview with a cat</h4>
<p>Both games allow the player to ‘choose’ their story or how the game is played. Jurassic heart differs from an interview with a cat in that it has type entry and click mouse entry. Similarly, their mechanics are made to allow the player to make their own choices whereas other games have their story set already. I found this important because it makes it feel like I have control over the conversation.</p>
<br>
<h4> Coffin Counseling </h4>
<p>This game also provides the option to interact with the characters in the game. The moving mechanics that allowed the main character(bat) fly was somewhat difficult to control, but as I played more, I got used to it. However, I think how the controls were designed was clever. Overall, the tone and design are very nice well built. I think the only suggestion that can make the game a bit more appealing was if there was some kind of reward system. </p>

<p>The difference between observing and playing a game is that observing allows one to learn new techniques or methods that were not noticed/ discovered before. For example, when my partner Jack played the game This is the only level, I noticed he played differently to me. He found out other ways of beating the level whereas I thought about other ones or I would give up. There was a level that said something about refresh and as I observed him playing it, I suggested that he tried to press the button longer, but he thought about refreshing in the literal sense, which was right. Playing a game is different because sometimes one doesn’t notice different ways of beating a game. For instance, In the same game played with my partner, I was a bit too excited to play it, and didn’t realize that I was going too fast and did not see the whole picture of what was going on. My partner Jack helped me out with the level. Observing and playing a game should go together because more is learned this way.
