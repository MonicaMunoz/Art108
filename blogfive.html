<h3>A Smoking Gun: A Charles Valentine Detective Story

By Jack Fogerson and Monica Munoz</h3>
<br>

<p> My role in the game is the Artist. I made the art and my partner the programmer, uploaded the images into the game. <br>I was not sure how well my players would react to the game because I felt that we needed more time to further develop our ideas and assort every logistics that we felt had to be done. <br> However, after reading some feedback from players, my partner and I received great comments. <br> Some mentioned that they love how the story matches the art nicely and that the novel based game is something very enjoyable. Some suggestions that were recommended are that perhaps no voice-over might be better to have a successful novel. <br> Also, a player recommended that the type of music that works best would be jazz in addition to changing some loud aspects of the game. Overall, we received a lot of positive comments. I found these considerations extremely helpful. After looking over all the feedback, my partner and I decided to fix those minor problems like those of the audio and add some more details - like a few more characters to polish the story.</p>
