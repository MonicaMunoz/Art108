      <p>Internet Arcade-Astro blaster</p>
      <p> I really enjoyed playing Astro Blaster. At first, I was not sure how to play it because the list on the bottom doesn't display the actual shooting control. After reading the comments on the bottom, I learned that the control button is the one to shoot. Other than that, the game is pretty straightforward and entertaining. I did play quite a bit but did not get far into the game. It definitely reminds me of other old school games I've watched my older brothers play. Similar games they would play were mainly played on computers. The game setup is not very different to many basic one and two player game. Anyone can absolutely enjoy it although it is very challenging. Playing this game on the computer does give it a different feel. It didn't feel as comfortable and also the button structure could be explained better. However, for being an emulator based game onto a laptop, it is not bad at all. Although I did not reach far in the game, I think I will come back to play it again. Maybe next time I will have a better time and enjoy it more. I will try to take my time and really learn a way to get a higher score.

      <h6> <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance">The resistence</a></h6>

      <p> My classmates and I played the game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1902896/fireworks-office/html/">Hanabi</a>. At first, we were going to play The Resistance, however we did not know how to play it. We tried it, but got lost fairly quickly.  Our classmate Mona brought Hanabi and told us how to play it. She told us that the main idea or essentially how to win is that all players goal is to make fireworks-to play the cards in order for each of the five colors of fireworks. To lose the game, there must not be any tokens left or cards on the pile. The hard or challenging aspect of the game was that we must remain our cards visible to the other players but we are not able to see our cards. We started with 5 cards and going clockwise, we took turns telling each other what the other player has. In one instance, I told Bianca that she had a white colored card. Other times, Kenneth told Mona she had a 4. We kept telling each other what cards had colors and numbers that would total the 5 cards necessary to make the fireworks. Towards the end of the game, we had 2 sections that were fireworks. In the beginning of  the game, we did have times in which we got somewhat confused, and had to explain to each other how to play, but overall it was a surprisingly fun game. Kenneth and Bianca seemed very into the game and Mona did a great job explaining the gameplay. Dabria also did a great job multitasking- she took good notes. </p>
