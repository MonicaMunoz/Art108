    <p>Internet Arcade-Astro blaster</p>
    <p> I really enjoyed playing Astro Blaster. At first, I was not sure how to play it because the list on the bottom doesn't display the actual shooting control. After reading the comments on the bottom, I learned that the control button is the one to shoot. Other than that, the game is pretty straightforward and entertaining. I did play quite a bit but did not get far into the game. It definitely reminds me of other old school games I've watched my older brothers play. Similar games they would play were mainly played on computers. The game setup is not very different to many basic one and two player game. Anyone can absolutely enjoy it although it is very challenging. Playing this game on the computer does give it a different feel. It didn't feel as comfortable and also the button structure could be explained better. However, for being an emulator based game onto a laptop, it is not bad at all. Although I did not reach far in the game, I think I will come back to play it again. Maybe next time I will have a better time and enjoy it more. I will try to take my time and really learn a way to get a higher score.
