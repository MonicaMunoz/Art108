<h3> Jackbox games</h3>
<br>

<p>In the Jackbox games, I played the game Bracketeering. At first, the game didn’t look very interesting. I was somewhat confused as to what was going on because it seemed like players were just selecting random answers. The game consists of collecting the most coins or points by selecting the most ‘popular’ answer and the one who earns the most is the winner. Players are essentially predicting or guessing what the other players selected. The answers displayed on the screen were definitely amusing and fun. My experience with my peers was absolutely enjoyable. We were all active and genuinely having a great time. I have never actually played a game with other people before and I think that it is definitely something I would like to do more in the future. Playing with an audience affects the game because at least for me, I felt somewhat pressured to write or select the best answer. For example, In one of the questions, there was a question on a funny word. I chose one that sounded a little humorous because I didn’t want anyone to think it was weird or point it out. However, I think that having an audience is nice because there is absolutely more engagement for both parties. </p>
